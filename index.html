            <h3 class="hidden">Became a designer</h3>
    				<p class="description">I want to share you about my life experiences that how I became a designer. I grew up the only deaf person in my family and friends in Colombia. I consider necessary to relate a fact that has marked who I am. I was born normal and full hearing. However, when I turned two years old, became deaf due to meningitis. This was a great challenge for me as I grew up in Colombia, a country with less developed public policies towards people living with disabilities.</p>

            <h3 class="hidden"> My life in USA</h3>
            <p class="description">I struggled with my high school to understand classes because it didn’t provide my full needs. I only enjoyed a class that I painted different type of paints and learned history of Art. Therefore, I did not know what I identified myself with until 2009 after I graduated from high school and went to Gallaudet University to learn American Sign Language (ASL) and English in United States of America. In this University, I met the Deaf community and its culture.</p>

            <h3 class="hidden">Graphic Designer</h3>
            <p class="description">After completing my ASL and English, my goal was to get a degree in fashion design at Parsons School of Design in New York City or Istituto Europe di Design in Milan, Italy, but my path changed everything, when I took Studio Fundamental’s class at George Mason University. Through this institution that I discovered that I wanted to become a designer since I loved visual communication. I transferred to the Art Institute of Washington (AIW) from George Mason University. I graduated from graphic and web design major at AIW with a concentration in graphic design.</p>

            <h3 class="hidden">An Optimistic Girl</h3>
            <p class="description">I am Ting-Hsuan Tsao and I go by Sandra. I've been in Canada for almost three years now. Before coming to Canada, I spent a year in Tucson, Arizona for my grade 10. For my first two years in Canada, I stayed in Chatham, a city in between London and Windsor. I'm not sure if it's because of how short the time I had, or I have been moving from place to place during my high school years. I never actually had time to think about what I would like to do in the future. It was kind of a hurry for me to decide what program I would like to apply to for college, so I thought I would apply for something that maybe I would be good at. Therefore, I came to Fanshawe to study Interactive Media Design.</p>

            <h3 class="hidden">Do I Regret?</h3>
            <p class="description">To be honest, I like Interactive Media Design. I like coding and all these weird languages we learn in class. It is very fun to have the ability to build a website from scratch. To have all kinds of experiments in the process of being creative. I also found that I can pick up with whatever is going on in class fairly quickly. However, there is just always this question in my head, "Is this what I want to do as a job...?" This might sound a bit dramatic, but I guess this is how people figure out what they want to do in life. I don't regret coming to Fanshawe for this program, but I might apply to an university after finishing my program instead of going straight into the work force.</p>

            <h3 class="hidden">More About Sandra</h3>
            <p class="description">When I find something I love to do and interested in, I get very passionate and motivated. I would spend a lot of time doing that thing. For example, I love makeup. All kind of cosmetics can make me want to just sit down and enjoy my time playing around with different makeup looks. Not only to be creative, but also spend time loving myself, taking care of myself, and mkaing myself a better person. That kind of thing would be something I want to do for my life. I am taking my time to figure out what would be the thing that can do what makeup do to me and I can do it for my life as a job. </p>
