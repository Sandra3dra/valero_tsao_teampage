        <h3 class="hidden">Became a designer</h3>
				<p class="description"> I want to share you about my life experiences that how I became a
			  designer. I grew up the only deaf person in my family and friends in Colombia.
			  I consider necessary to relate a fact that has marked who I am. I was born normal
			  and full hearing. However, when I turned two years old, became deaf due to meningitis.
			  This was a great challenge for me as I grew up in Colombia, a country with less developed public
			  policies towards people living with disabilities.</p>

      <div class="biography">
        <h3 class="hidden"> My life in USA</h3>
        <p class="description">I struggled with my high school to understand classes because it didn’t provide my full needs.
			  I only enjoyed a class that I painted different type of paints and learned history of Art. Therefore,
			  I did not know what I identified myself with until 2009 after I graduated from high school and went to
			  Gallaudet University to learn American Sign Language (ASL) and English in United States of America. In this
				University, I met the Deaf community and its culture.

        <div class="biography">
        <h3 class="hidden">Graphic Designer</h3>
         <p class="description">After completing my ASL and English, my goal was to get a degree in fashion design at Parsons School of Design
				 in New York City or Istituto Europe di Design in Milan, Italy. But, my path changed everything, when I took Studio Fundamental’s class at George Mason University.
				 Through this institution that I discovered that I wanted to become a designer since I loved visual communication. I transferred to the Art Institute of Washington (AIW) from George Mason University. I graduated from graphic and web design major at AIW with a concentration
				 in graphic design. </p>
